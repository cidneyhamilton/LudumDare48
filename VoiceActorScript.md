## Introducing the therapy session

**Eliza**: My chamber, lord, to thee I beg a chance / To wit amend thy crag-swept countenance [Eliza001]

**Eliza**: The glimpse of madness I've seen in thy face / Can physician with tapper chase away. [Eliza002]

**Eliza**: If thou sit'st here with me and close thine eyes, / And fold thy hands across thy breast like so, [Eliza003]

**Eliza**: My art that Freud and Jung taught down from high, / That flourishes in clinic and in school, [Eliza004]

**Eliza**: Can drive the demons from within thy mind, / And bring thee to a state of better health. [Eliza005]

**Regan**: Speak plainly, woman. What wilt thou of me? [Regan001]

**Eliza**: Sit, sit, lord. And speak of thy memories. [Eliza006]

**Regan**: My memories are mine. I dare not share. [Regan002]

**Eliza**: Then merely think of them. I dare not pry. [Eliza007]

**Regan**: But thou canst help me? [Regan003]

**Eliza**: Yea, sir. Tap left then right then left again. / While visting the trauma of thy past. [Eliza008]

**Regan**: I'll play thy game, doctor. When do I start? [Regan004]

**Eliza**: Now. Think of a memory of the past. / If thou succeedst, we'll try the next flashback. [Eliza009]

## On failing a rhythm challenge

**Eliza**: My lord, remember what I bid thee do / Tap left, then right, as quickly as thou canst. [Eliza010]

## After the first flashback

**Eliza**: Well done, my lord. Thou hast accessed a glimpse, / Of what thy mind will do whence processed this. [Eliza011]

**Regan**: I saw a woman's face-- [Regan005]

**Eliza**: That's thy late wife. / Thy greatest partner in thy enterprise. [Eliza012]

**Eliza**: She led thy rise from partner to exec. / When cowardice unmanned thee she was there. [Eliza013]

**Regan**: She should have died hereafter. [Regan006]

**Eliza**: Thou thinkst thou can anticipate hereafter? [Eliza014]

**Regan**: Aye; three witches did for me last winter. [Regan007]

**Eliza**: Perhaps that should be our next memory? [Eliza015]

**Regan**: Perhaps. [Regan008]

**Eliza**: Prepare thy tappers; we'll begin again. [Eliza016]

## After the Second Flashback

**Regan**: The witches were the first to see the truth. / They galled me into murder and I flew. [Regan009]

**Regan**: Once this might have seemed the right thing to do, / But now I have an empire in uproar. [Regan010]

**Regan**: I start to see why it was wise of me. / To block these wisps of mem'ry from my mind. [Regan011]

**Eliza**: Shall we move on? Thou wouldst be wise to end / This quest for self-discovery thou hast embarked. [Eliza017]

**Regan**: Begin again, good doctor. Make it quick. [Regan012]

**Eliza**: Dost thou really want to know the answer? / Deeper still must we dive into the matter. [Eliza018]

## After the Third Flashback

**Regan**: What is this? Does thou seek to drive me mad? [Regan013]

**Eliza**: Nay, my lord, thy downfall would lack sweetness. / Should thouh forget what ledst thee to this place. [Eliza019]

**Eliza**: Now come and lead thine army to its ruin. / Led by a man not yet of woman born. [Eliza020]

**Eliza**: Now, at least, our chase can be brought to end. [Eliza021]

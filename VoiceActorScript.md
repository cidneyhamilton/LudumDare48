# Dialogue Lines

## Introducing the therapy session

**Eliza**: My chamber, lord, to thee I beg a chance / To wit amend thy crag-swept countenance

**Eliza**: The glimpse of madness I've seen in thy face / Can physician with tapper chase away.

**Eliza**: If thou sit'st here with me and close thine eyes, / And fold thy hands across thy breast like so,

**Eliza**: My art that Freud and Jung taught down from high, / That flourishes in clinic and in school,

**Eliza**: Can drive the demons from within thy mind, / And bring thee to a state of better health.

**Regan**: Speak plainly, woman. What wilt thou of me?

**Eliza**: Sit, sit, lord. And speak of thy memories.

**Regan**: My memories are mine. I dare not share.

**Eliza**: Then merely think of them. I dare not pry.

**Regan**: But thou canst help me?

**Eliza**: Yea, sir. Tap left then right then left again. / While visting the trauma of thy past.

**Regan**: I'll play thy game, doctor. When do I start?

**Eliza**: Now. Think of a memory of the past. / If thou succeedst, we'll try the next flashback.

## On failing a rhythm challenge

**Eliza**: My lord, remember what I bid thee do / Tap left, then right, as quickly as thou canst.

## After the first flashback

**Eliza**: Well done, my lord. Thou hast accessed a glimpse, / Of what thy mind will do whence processed this.

**Regan**: I saw a woman's face--

**Eliza**: That's thy late wife. / Thy greatest partner in thy enterprise.

**Eliza**: She led thy rise from partner to exec. / When cowardice unmanned thee she was there.

**Regan**: She should have died hereafter.

**Eliza**: Thou thinkst thou can anticipate hereafter?

**Regan**: Aye; three witches did for me last winter.

**Eliza**: Perhaps that should be our next memory?

**Regan**: Perhaps.

**Eliza**: Prepare thy tappers; we'll begin again.

## After the Second Flashback

**Regan**: The witches were the first to see the truth. / They galled me into murder and I flew.

**Regan**: Once this might have seemed the right thing to do, / But now I have an empire in uproar.

**Regan**: I start to see why it was wise of me. / To block these wisps of mem'ry from my mind.

**Eliza**: Shall we move on? Thou wouldst be wise to end / This quest for self-discovery thou hast embarked.

**Regan**: Begin again, good doctor. Make it quick.

**Eliza**: Dost thou really want to know the answer? / Deeper still must we dive into the matter.

## After the Third Flashback

**Regan**: What is this? Does thou seek to drive me mad?

**Eliza**: Nay, my lord, thy downfall would lack sweetness. / Should thouh forget what ledst thee to this place.

**Eliza**: Now come and lead thine army to its ruin. / Led by a man not yet of woman born.

**Eliza**: Now, at least, our chase can be brought to end.

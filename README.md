# Ludum Dare 48: Deeper and Deeper

Delve deeper and deeper into your memories.

The Clinic was a short game created for Ludum Dare: 48; Deeper and Deeper to explore the use of EMDR as a game mechanic. Storyline heavily borrowed from Shakespeare, and format heavily borrowed from the Black Rose arc of Shoujo Kakumei Utena.

Tap left, then right, then left again while your therapist guides you through flashbacks in order to reintegrate your memories.
